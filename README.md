WORDLE GAME


Backend C++ version of the popular web-based Wordle game that lets the player guess random 5-letter words.

It's a short and beginner-level project as it was the first project I worked on in my freshman year of college. 
I learned how to utilize file handling to pick random words from a .txt file with 5000+ words.

In the future, I would love to work on the front end of this project and create a full replica.
